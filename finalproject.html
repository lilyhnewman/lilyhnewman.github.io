<h1>19 Million Americans Can't Get Internet--Here's Why:</h2>

	<h3><b>Red dots/regions represent counties in which fewer than 50 percent of residences have access to broadband internet.</b></h3>

	<p><blockquote>According to the <a href="http://www.broadbandmap.gov/">National Broadband Map</a>, populated by a 2011 FCC study, 19 million Americans do not have access to broadband internet, meaning there is no way for them to subscribe in their home. And 172 counties (out of 3,141) in the U.S. have less than 50 percent access. This may sound like a minor concern, but lack of access in these 172 counties may contribute to reduced economic growth and potential for social mobility--putting these extremely rural or financially disadvantaged counties at an even greater disadvantage.</blockquote></p>

      <li><p><em>It's all about geography . . . </em> Inhabitants of Keweenaw County, MI (the red region above Wisconsin) actually have completely reasonable broadband access. The county comes up as having less than 50 percent coverage because more than half of its area is . . . water. Soooo yeah.</p></li>
      <li><p><em>Socioeconomic breakdown . . .</em> Elsewhere, the situation is more problematic, though. For example, in <a href="http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/index.html">all four counties</a> of Alabama that have less than 50 percent access, the average yearly income per household is half the state average. If families in a given community do not have the disposable income to afford subscribing to broadband, providers may not think it is worth the investment to bring access to the area.</p></li>
      <li><p><em>And population</em> This is especially true in rural communities with a low population density where the initial infrastructure investment is high for providers. In McPherson County, NE, for example, the population density is effectively zero because the county, which is 860 square miles, only has 509 inhabitants.</p></li>
      <li><p><em>It's also more complicated than just who has access and who doesn't</em> According to the FCC, 19 million people, or about six percent of the U.S. population, can't access broadband in their area at all. But there are also <a href="http://www.digitaltrends.com/web/why-are-one-third-of-americans-turning-their-backs-on-high-speed-internet/#ixzz2XouPI9L5">100 million Americans</a> who could subscribe if they wanted to. But they don't. Reasons range from inability to pay, to lack of <a href="http://pewinternet.org/~/media/Files/Reports/2012/PIP_Digital_differences_041312.pdf">computer literacy.</a></p></li>
