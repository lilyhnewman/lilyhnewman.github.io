<h2>Lily's Final Project Pitches</h2>

<h3>Broadband Access In Rural U.S. Counties</h3>

The FCC has most recently provided <a href="http://a.tiles.mapbox.com/v3/fcc.Section-706-Fixed-Broadband-Deployment-Map/page.html#4.00/38.00/-98.00">data from 2011</a> about the status of broadband internet access in every U.S. county. I would like to use these data to identify which counties still lack web access and attempt to determine why. Presumably the barrier in most counties is physical, meaning it is caused by geographic constraints like mountains, but there are other obstacles as well. Recently there have been renewed efforts in <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5995163/rural-california-finally-gets-broadband-internet-still-waiting-for-second-gold-rush">California</a> and <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5995487/gigabit-internet-in-vermont-is-cheaper-than-google-fiber">Vermont</a> to bring broadband to extreme rural areas through novel technologies, so I would like to use my data analysis to create an info graphic about the feasibility of bringing broadband or alternatives everywhere in the US. It would also be interesting if I discovered a county that is intentionally resisting access, though I have no idea if this exists. This piece would be targeted at a tech pub or could work as commentary in a general-interest national news pub.


<h3>Where Do Animals Die The Most In NYC?</h3>
I want to use nyc.gov data about <a href="https://nycopendata.socrata.com/Social-Services/Animals/6rs3-kg3k">311 animal complaints</a> to map reports of dead animals around the city. I'm interested to see if more animals die near parks, the rivers, or canals. It's also possible that animal deaths are distributed fairly evenly, in which case I would want to look at neighborhoods with the lowest death count. This would probably be a sort of around town infographic and I would highlight specific instances of exotic or unexpected animal carcasses. This would be a WNYC or Gothamist type of piece. I like the data set because it's updated regularly and goes back three years. It would be interesting if higher/lower neighborhood animal deaths corresponded with another neighborhood trend like real estate prices or number of all night diners or something. But that layer would depend on the primary analysis.
