<h2>NEWZ IZ ERRWURR???</h2>

<p>Honestly, the number of people relying on radio for news has been low for a long time. But the Internet is on its way up compared to TV and newspapers. If you don't know what the Internet is you should check it out. Also how are you here right now? Go read the news. Actually don't because then I'll have to change this chart. Also Americans shouldn't rely so heavily on TV news because it's kinda terrible. </p>
